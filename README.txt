This application was made while I was in high school, and before Android had a real timekeeping application. At the time, all there was was a relatively inflexible alarm application, and a standard desk clock application. 

This project sought to improve on that, through a swipe-based UI, a consistent visual style, and many more functions. The functions are:
	stopwatch, where it can pop out in a hovering window
	alarm, which can be heavily customised based on intervals of repetition
	timer, repeated timer
	homescreen widgets

The application assumes that the user does not do a few illogical things, such as set the interval of repetition so fast that the phone/application cannot keep up. There are probably some other bugs as well, as this was made in high school, and hasn't been touched for some time.

However, it is still a good exercise in nearly all the fundamentals of Android application building, as it involves custom gestures, custom UI widgets, custom homescreen widgets, a service, dynamically altering the UI layout, using the StandOut library, and using the SQLite database capabilities built into Android.
